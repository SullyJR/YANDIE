## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The Source Code File (src) contains two folders, where:

- `cosc202\andie` : the folder where the Java files are located, including the icons files and language text files
- `test` : the folder where the unit testing is located 

The workspace also contains two files, where:

- `.gitignore` : the file that tells git which files to ignore
- `README.md` : the markdown text file whih describes the GitHub project
